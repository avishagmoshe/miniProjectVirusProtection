# miniProjectVirusProtection
A mini project how to prevent from user to send malicious email containing virus.

In this mini project I preventd from  a user to send a malicious email that containing virus.
If you would ask your computer ,there is a pretty goon anti-virus program on it , so traing to send actual virus is not
posible.
So I've send a malicious line that mimic a virus.
By using Hash maps I could say in a probability if that line is shown in the email , and if so , not sending it.
